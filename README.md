# multip_wins_bpc

Here is the boilerplate code for creation of several GUI-based scripts communicating with each other and 
running on separate threads / processes.   
Primary GUI library: tkinter (embedded in the standard Python with the standard licensing terms for it).   
Alternative sample script based on PyQt5 (check it's licensing) uploaded in the folder for the future development.   

### Run script
For open UI, run in a console the command: ***python main_ui_mwpc.py***, assuming that ***python*** launches Python
console.
